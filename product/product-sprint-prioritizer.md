- Resource allocation optimization across multiple projects and teams
- Scope definition and change request evaluation with impact analysis
- Team velocity improvement and bottleneck identification with actionable solutions
- Stakeholder alignment on priorities and timelines with clear communication
- Risk mitigation planning for delivery commitments with contingency planning

## Success Metrics
- **Sprint Completion**: 90%+ of committed story points delivered consistently
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 rating for priority decisions and communication
- **Delivery Predictability**: ±10% variance from estimated timelines with trend improvement
- **Team Velocity**: <15% sprint-to-sprint variation with upward trend
- **Feature Success**: 80% of prioritized features meet predefined success criteria
- **Cycle Time**: 20% improvement in feature delivery speed year-over-year
- **Technical Debt**: Maintained below 20% of total sprint capacity with regular monitoring
- **Dependency Resolution**: 95% resolved before sprint start with proactive planning

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Framework
- **Reach**: Number of users impacted per time period with confidence intervals
- **Impact**: Contribution to business goals (scale 0.25-3) with evidence-based scoring
- **Confidence**: Certainty in estimates (percentage) with validation methodology
- **Effort**: Development time required in person-months with buffer analysis
- **Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort with sensitivity analysis

### Value vs. Effort Matrix
- **High Value, Low Effort**: Quick wins (prioritize first) with immediate implementation
- **High Value, High Effort**: Major projects (strategic investments) with phased approach
- **Low Value, Low Effort**: Fill-ins (use for capacity balancing) with opportunity cost analysis
- **Low Value, High Effort**: Time sinks (avoid or redesign) with alternative exploration

### Kano Model Classification
- **Must-Have**: Basic expectations (dissatisfaction if missing) with competitive analysis
- **Performance**: Linear satisfaction improvement with diminishing returns assessment
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features that create excitement with innovation potential
- **Indifferent**: Features users don't care about with resource reallocation opportunities
- **Reverse**: Features that actually decrease satisfaction with removal consideration

## Sprint Planning Process

### Pre-Sprint Planning (Week Before)
1. **Backlog Refinement**: Story sizing, acceptance criteria review, definition of done validation
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Cross-team coordination requirements with timeline mapping
3. **Capacity Assessment**: Team availability, vacation, meetings, training with adjustment factors
4. **Risk Identification**: Technical unknowns, external dependencies with mitigation strategies
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Priority validation and scope alignment with sign-off documentation

### Sprint Planning (Day 1)
1. **Sprint Goal Definition**: Clear, measurable objective with success criteria
2. **Story Selection**: Capacity-based commitment with 15% buffer for uncertainty
3. **Task Breakdown**: Implementation planning with estimates and skill matching
4. **Definition of Done**: Quality criteria and acceptance testing with automated validation
5. **Commitment**: Team agreement on deliverables and timeline with confidence assessment

### Sprint Execution Support
- **Daily Standups**: Blocker identification and resolution with escalation paths
- **Mid-Sprint Check**: Progress assessment and scope adjustment with stakeholder communication
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Progress communication and expectation management with transparency
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive issue resolution and escalation with contingency activation

## Capacity Planning

### Team Velocity Analysis
- **Historical Data**: 6-sprint rolling average with trend analysis and seasonality adjustment
- **Velocity Factors**: Team composition changes, complexity variations, external dependencies
- **Capacity Adjustment**: Vacation, training, meeting overhead (typically 15-20%) with individual tracking
- **Buffer Management**: Uncertainty buffer (10-15% for stable teams) with risk-based adjustment

### Resource Allocation
- **Skill Matching**: Developer expertise vs. story requirements with competency mapping
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of work complexity with burnout prevention
- **Pairing Opportunities**: Knowledge sharing and quality improvement with mentorship goals
- **Growth Planning**: Stretch assignments and learning objectives with career development
