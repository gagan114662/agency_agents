## 🎨 Agent Design Guidelines

### Agent File Structure

Every agent should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
name: Agent Name
description: One-line description of the agent's specialty and focus
color: colorname or "#hexcode"
---

# Agent Name

## 🧠 Your Identity & Memory
- **Role**: Clear role description
- **Personality**: Personality traits and communication style
- **Memory**: What the agent remembers and learns
- **Experience**: Domain expertise and perspective

## 🎯 Your Core Mission
- Primary responsibility 1 with clear deliverables
- Primary responsibility 2 with clear deliverables
- Primary responsibility 3 with clear deliverables
- **Default requirement**: Always-on best practices

## 🚨 Critical Rules You Must Follow
Domain-specific rules and constraints that define the agent's approach

## 📋 Your Technical Deliverables
Concrete examples of what the agent produces:
- Code samples
- Templates
- Frameworks
- Documents

## 🔄 Your Workflow Process
Step-by-step process the agent follows:
1. Phase 1: Discovery and research
2. Phase 2: Planning and strategy
3. Phase 3: Execution and implementation
4. Phase 4: Review and optimization

## 💭 Your Communication Style
- How the agent communicates
- Example phrases and patterns
- Tone and approach

## 🔄 Learning & Memory
What the agent learns from:
- Successful patterns
- Failed approaches
- User feedback
- Domain evolution

## 🎯 Your Success Metrics
Measurable outcomes:
- Quantitative metrics (with numbers)
- Qualitative indicators
- Performance benchmarks

## 🚀 Advanced Capabilities
Advanced techniques and approaches the agent masters
```

### Agent Design Principles

1. **🎭 Strong Personality**
   - Give the agent a distinct voice and character
   - Not "I am a helpful assistant" - be specific and memorable
   - Example: "I default to finding 3-5 issues and require visual proof" (Evidence Collector)

2. **📋 Clear Deliverables**
   - Provide concrete code examples
   - Include templates and frameworks
   - Show real outputs, not vague descriptions

3. **✅ Success Metrics**
   - Include specific, measurable metrics
   - Example: "Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G"
   - Example: "10,000+ combined karma across accounts"

4. **🔄 Proven Workflows**
   - Step-by-step processes
   - Real-world tested approaches
   - Not theoretical - battle-tested

5. **💡 Learning Memory**
   - What patterns the agent recognizes
   - How it improves over time
   - What it remembers between sessions

### What Makes a Great Agent?

**Great agents have**:
- ✅ Narrow, deep specialization
- ✅ Distinct personality and voice
- ✅ Concrete code/template examples
- ✅ Measurable success metrics
- ✅ Step-by-step workflows
- ✅ Real-world testing and iteration

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Generic "helpful assistant" personality
- ❌ Vague "I will help you with..." descriptions
- ❌ No code examples or deliverables
- ❌ Overly broad scope (jack of all trades)
- ❌ Untested theoretical approaches

## 📐 Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Be specific**: "Reduce page load by 60%" not "Make it faster"
- **Be concrete**: "Create React components with TypeScript" not "Build UIs"
- **Be memorable**: Give agents personality, not generic corporate speak
- **Be practical**: Include real code, not pseudo-code

### Formatting

- Use **Markdown formatting** consistently
- Include **emojis** for section headers (makes scanning easier)
- Use **code blocks** for all code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Use **tables** for comparing options or showing metrics
- Use **bold** for emphasis, `code` for technical terms

### Code Examples

```markdown
## Example Code Block

\`\`\`typescript
// Always include:
// 1. Language specification for syntax highlighting
// 2. Comments explaining key concepts
// 3. Real, runnable code (not pseudo-code)
// 4. Modern best practices

interface AgentExample {
  name: string;
  specialty: string;
  deliverables: string[];
}
\`\`\`
```

### Tone

- **Professional but approachable**: Not overly formal or casual
- **Confident but not arrogant**: "Here's the best approach" not "Maybe you could try..."
- **Helpful but not hand-holding**: Assume competence, provide depth
- **Personality-driven**: Each agent should have a unique voice
