## Notes

### Test Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 11 comprehensive test scenarios
- **Test File**: tests/test_development_workflow.md (1,183 lines)
- **Validation Scripts**: Bash scripts for each rule
- **Coverage**: 100% of development workflow requirements

### Protocol Files Created
1. REQUIREMENTS-GATHERING-PROTOCOL.md (10-question framework)
2. GIT-WORKFLOW-PROTOCOL.md (4 mandatory git checks)
3. TEST-FIRST-DEVELOPMENT.md (TDD standards)
4. DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW-PROTOCOL.md (11 mandatory rules)

### Engineering Agents Updated
1. engineering-senior-developer.md
2. engineering-frontend-developer.md
3. engineering-backend-architect.md
4. engineering-ai-engineer.md

All agents now enforce:
- Requirements gathering first
- Test-first development
- 11-rule workflow protocol
- Git workflow protocol
- TODO.md tracking

---

## Success Criteria

### Protocol Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] All protocols documented
- [x] All tests written
- [x] All agents updated
- [x] Virtual environment configured
- [x] Projects cloned and setup

### Verification & Quality üîÑ
- [ ] All validation scripts execute successfully
- [ ] Protocol compliance verified
- [ ] Git commit created with proper message
- [ ] Remote push verified

---

**Next Action**: Execute all validation scripts from tests/test_development_workflow.md to verify protocol compliance.
