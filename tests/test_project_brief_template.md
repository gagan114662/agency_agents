[Brief description of main entities and their relationships]

## Core Entities

### Entity: User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;                    // UUID, primary key
  email: string;                 // Unique, required
  password_hash: string;         // Bcrypt hashed
  name: string;                  // Required
  avatar_url?: string;           // Optional, S3 URL
  role: 'user' | 'admin';       // Enum
  created_at: Date;             // Timestamp
  updated_at: Date;             // Auto-updated
  last_login?: Date;            // Optional tracking
}
```

**Relationships**:
- Has many: Posts, Comments
- Belongs to: Organization (optional)

**Business Rules**:
- Email must be unique and validated
- Password minimum 8 characters, requires complexity
- Users cannot delete account with active subscriptions
- Soft delete preserves data for 30 days

**Indexes**:

| Field | Validation | Error Message |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| User.email | Email format + unique | "Invalid email address" |
| User.password | Min 8 chars + complexity | "Password too weak" |
| Post.title | 5-100 characters | "Title must be 5-100 chars" |

## Business Logic Flows

### Flow: User Registration
1. Validate email format and uniqueness
2. Hash password with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
3. Create user record
4. Send verification email
5. Log registration event
6. Return JWT token

### Unit Tests (70% of tests)
**Framework**: [e.g., Jest / Vitest / pytest]
**Coverage**:
- All business logic functions
- Utility functions
- Data validation
- Error handling

**Example Test**:
```typescript
import { validateEmail } from '@/utils/validation';

describe('validateEmail', () => {
  it('should accept valid email', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should reject invalid email', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests (20% of tests)
**Framework**: [e.g., Supertest / Testing Library]
**Coverage**:
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External service integrations
- Authentication flows

**Example Test**:
```typescript
describe('POST /api/users', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'SecurePass123!' });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)
**Framework**: [e.g., Cypress / Playwright]
**Coverage**:
- User registration flow
- Login flow
- Core feature workflows
- Payment flow (if applicable)

**Example Test**:
```typescript
test('user can complete registration', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/register');
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'SecurePass123!');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```
