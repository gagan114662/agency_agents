It ensures that every agent follows best practices for requirements gathering, test-first development, git hygiene, and production-ready code delivery.

### What Makes This Special

- **🚫 No Shortcuts**: Agents MUST gather requirements before coding
- **✅ Test-First Always**: Tests written and approved before implementation
- **📋 11 Mandatory Rules**: Every rule enforced for every task
- **🔍 Bash Validation**: Independent verification of logic and calculations
- **🎯 Production-Ready**: Clean code with no TODOs, debug statements, or commented code
- **📝 Full Transparency**: TODO.md tracking for all tasks

## 🚀 The 11 Mandatory Workflow Rules

Every engineering agent now enforces these rules for EVERY task:

### Rule 1: Pre-Work Test Approval ✅
- **ALWAYS** get user approval on tests BEFORE writing any implementation code
- Tests must import from actual modules (no hardcoded values)
- Ensures mutual understanding of expected behavior

### Rule 2: Git Commit Checkpoint Protocol ✅
- Ask user before creating git commits
- Create commits at logical milestones
- Follow 4 mandatory git checks before every push

### Rule 3: Logging Standards Enforcement ✅
- Use INFO level for production logging
- DEBUG for development only
- NO print() or console.log() in production code

### Rule 4: Bash Test Validation for Math/Logic ✅
- Create bash validation scripts for calculations
- Independent verification of critical logic
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Rule 5: Code Organization Standards ✅
- No duplicate functions across codebase
- Proper file structure and organization
- Single responsibility principle

### Rule 6: Local Testing Before Deployment ✅
- Run ALL tests locally
- Verify 100% pass rate
- Check coverage meets minimum threshold (80%+)

### Rule 7: Production-Ready Code Standards ✅
- No commented-out code blocks
- No TODO/FIXME comments
- No debug statements or logging

### Rule 8: User Decision Points with Options ✅
- Present options at key decision points
- Include pros/cons for each option
- Get user approval before proceeding

### Rule 9: Copy-Paste Ready Commands ✅
- All commands must be executable as-is
- No placeholders like `<your-path>`
- Use actual values and paths

### Rule 10: Virtual Environment Management ✅
- Use shared virtual environment
- Path: `/Users/gagan/Desktop/gagan_projects/venv`
- Python 3.13.7 with proper dependency management

### Rule 11: TODO.md File Tracking ✅

## 🎯 What This Achieves

Your Claude Code engineering agents will now **automatically**:

✅ Gather comprehensive requirements before any coding
✅ Write tests first and get approval before implementation
✅ Follow all 11 workflow rules without exceptions
✅ Ask for approval at key checkpoints
✅ Maintain clean, production-ready code
✅ Track all tasks transparently in TODO.md
✅ Use shared virtual environments correctly
✅ Provide copy-paste ready commands
✅ Present options with pros/cons at decision points
✅ Validate math/logic with bash scripts
✅ Ensure 100% test pass rate before deployment

### Before vs After

#### Before 😰
- Agents jump straight into coding without requirements
- No tests or tests written after implementation
- Debug statements left in production code
- Placeholders in documentation (`<your-path>`)
- Unclear what tasks remain
- Commits without user approval

#### After 😎
- Requirements gathered first, every time
- Tests written and approved before code
- Clean production code, zero debug statements
- All commands copy-paste ready
- Full task transparency in TODO.md
- User controls all commits

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Update Your Agents

The engineering agents in `~/.claude/agents/engineering/` have already been updated with the workflow protocol. When you use any of these agents in Claude Code, they will automatically follow all 11 rules.

### 2. Use the Protocols

When starting a new project with Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Agent will automatically gather requirements first
# 2. Agent will write tests and ask for approval
# 3. Agent will follow all 11 workflow rules
# 4. Agent will ask before creating git commits
```

### 3. Verify Compliance

Check that agents are following the protocol:

```bash
# Check TODO.md is being maintained
cat TODO.md

# Verify no print statements in production code
grep -r "print(" src/

# Verify tests exist
ls -la tests/

# Check git is clean
git status
```

---

## 📋 Protocol Compliance Checklist

Before completing ANY task, verify:

- [ ] **Rule 1**: Tests written and approved BEFORE implementation
- [ ] **Rule 2**: Git commit checkpoint asked and completed properly
- [ ] **Rule 3**: Logging standards followed (INFO level, no prints)
- [ ] **Rule 4**: Bash validation scripts created for math/logic
- [ ] **Rule 5**: Code organization checked (no duplicates, proper structure)
- [ ] **Rule 6**: All tests run locally and pass (100%)
- [ ] **Rule 7**: Production code clean (no TODOs, comments, debug)
- [ ] **Rule 8**: User consulted on all major decisions
- [ ] **Rule 9**: All commands are copy-paste ready (no placeholders)
- [ ] **Rule 10**: Virtual environment properly configured
- [ ] **Rule 11**: TODO.md updated with current status

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Feature

```bash
USER: "Add a shipping cost calculator to the app"

AGENT:
Step 1: Requirements Gathering (Rule 1 - Pre-requisite)
- What weight units? (lbs, kg, oz)
- How to calculate distance? (zip codes, GPS, manual?)
- Pricing tiers or flat rate?
[... 10+ questions covering all aspects]

Step 2: Write Tests First (Rule 1)
Creates tests/test_shipping_calculator.py
"I've written 15 tests for the shipping calculator. May I proceed with implementation?"

Step 3: Implementation (After Approval)
Implements feature to make tests pass

Step 4: Bash Validation (Rule 4)
Creates tests/validation/test_shipping_calc.sh
Validates calculations independently

Step 5: Update TODO.md (Rule 11)
Moves task to "Completed" section

Step 6: Git Commit (Rule 2)
"Feature complete. Would you like me to create a git commit?"
```

### Example 2: Code Review Check

The agent will automatically verify:

```bash
# No print statements
✅ grep -r "print(" src/  # Returns nothing

# No TODO comments
✅ grep -r "TODO" src/  # Returns nothing

# All tests pass
✅ pytest tests/ -v  # 100% pass rate

# Requirements file exists
✅ ls requirements.txt  # File exists

# TODO.md is updated
✅ cat TODO.md  # Shows current status
```
