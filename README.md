## üéØ What Is This?

This repository contains a comprehensive **Development Workflow Protocol** that enforces professional development practices across all Claude Code engineering agents. It ensures that every agent follows best practices for requirements gathering, test-first development, git hygiene, and production-ready code delivery.

### What Makes This Special

- **üö´ No Shortcuts**: Agents MUST gather requirements before coding
- **‚úÖ Test-First Always**: Tests written and approved before implementation
- **üìã 11 Mandatory Rules**: Every rule enforced for every task
- **üîç Bash Validation**: Independent verification of logic and calculations
- **üéØ Production-Ready**: Clean code with no TODOs, debug statements, or commented code

- Tests must import from actual modules (no hardcoded values)
- Ensures mutual understanding of expected behavior

### Rule 2: Git Commit Checkpoint Protocol ‚úÖ
- Ask user before creating git commits
- Create commits at logical milestones
- Follow 4 mandatory git checks before every push

### Rule 3: Logging Standards Enforcement ‚úÖ
- Use INFO level for production logging
- DEBUG for development only
- NO print() or console.log() in production code

### Rule 4: Bash Test Validation for Math/Logic ‚úÖ
- Create bash validation scripts for calculations
- Independent verification of critical logic
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Rule 5: Code Organization Standards ‚úÖ
- No duplicate functions across codebase
- Proper file structure and organization
- Single responsibility principle

### Rule 6: Local Testing Before Deployment ‚úÖ
- Run ALL tests locally
- Verify 100% pass rate
- Check coverage meets minimum threshold (80%+)

### Rule 7: Production-Ready Code Standards ‚úÖ
- No commented-out code blocks
- No TODO/FIXME comments
- No debug statements or logging

### Rule 8: User Decision Points with Options ‚úÖ
- Present options at key decision points
- Include pros/cons for each option
- Get user approval before proceeding

### Rule 9: Copy-Paste Ready Commands ‚úÖ
- All commands must be executable as-is
- No placeholders like `<your-path>`
- Use actual values and paths

### Rule 10: Virtual Environment Management ‚úÖ
- Use shared virtual environment
- Path: `/Users/gagan/Desktop/gagan_projects/venv`
- Python 3.13.7 with proper dependency management

### Rule 11: TODO.md File Tracking ‚úÖ
- Maintain TODO.md in project root
- Track In Progress/Pending/Completed tasks

## üéØ What This Achieves

Your Claude Code engineering agents will now **automatically**:

‚úÖ Gather comprehensive requirements before any coding
‚úÖ Write tests first and get approval before implementation
‚úÖ Follow all 11 workflow rules without exceptions
‚úÖ Ask for approval at key checkpoints
‚úÖ Maintain clean, production-ready code
‚úÖ Track all tasks transparently in TODO.md
‚úÖ Use shared virtual environments correctly
‚úÖ Provide copy-paste ready commands
‚úÖ Present options with pros/cons at decision points
‚úÖ Validate math/logic with bash scripts
‚úÖ Ensure 100% test pass rate before deployment

### Before vs After

#### Before üò∞
- Agents jump straight into coding without requirements
- No tests or tests written after implementation
- Debug statements left in production code
- Placeholders in documentation (`<your-path>`)
- Unclear what tasks remain
- Commits without user approval

#### After üòé
- Requirements gathered first, every time
- Tests written and approved before code
- Clean production code, zero debug statements
- All commands copy-paste ready
- Full task transparency in TODO.md
- User controls all commits

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Update Your Agents

The engineering agents in `~/.claude/agents/engineering/` have already been updated with the workflow protocol. When you use any of these agents in Claude Code, they will automatically follow all 11 rules.

### 2. Use the Protocols

When starting a new project with Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Agent will automatically gather requirements first
# 2. Agent will write tests and ask for approval
# 3. Agent will follow all 11 workflow rules
# 4. Agent will ask before creating git commits
```

### 3. Verify Compliance

Check that agents are following the protocol:

```bash
# Check TODO.md is being maintained
cat TODO.md

# Verify no print statements in production code
grep -r "print(" src/

# Verify tests exist
ls -la tests/

# Check git is clean
git status
```

---

## üìã Protocol Compliance Checklist

Before completing ANY task, verify:

- [ ] **Rule 1**: Tests written and approved BEFORE implementation
- [ ] **Rule 2**: Git commit checkpoint asked and completed properly
- [ ] **Rule 3**: Logging standards followed (INFO level, no prints)
- [ ] **Rule 4**: Bash validation scripts created for math/logic
- [ ] **Rule 5**: Code organization checked (no duplicates, proper structure)
- [ ] **Rule 6**: All tests run locally and pass (100%)
- [ ] **Rule 7**: Production code clean (no TODOs, comments, debug)
- [ ] **Rule 8**: User consulted on all major decisions
- [ ] **Rule 9**: All commands are copy-paste ready (no placeholders)
- [ ] **Rule 10**: Virtual environment properly configured
- [ ] **Rule 11**: TODO.md updated with current status

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Feature

```bash
USER: "Add a shipping cost calculator to the app"

AGENT:
Step 1: Requirements Gathering (Rule 1 - Pre-requisite)
- What weight units? (lbs, kg, oz)
- How to calculate distance? (zip codes, GPS, manual?)
- Pricing tiers or flat rate?
[... 10+ questions covering all aspects]

Step 2: Write Tests First (Rule 1)
Creates tests/test_shipping_calculator.py
"I've written 15 tests for the shipping calculator. May I proceed with implementation?"

Step 3: Implementation (After Approval)
Implements feature to make tests pass

Step 4: Bash Validation (Rule 4)
Creates tests/validation/test_shipping_calc.sh
Validates calculations independently

Step 5: Update TODO.md (Rule 11)
Moves task to "Completed" section

Step 6: Git Commit (Rule 2)
"Feature complete. Would you like me to create a git commit?"
```

### Example 2: Code Review Check

The agent will automatically verify:

```bash
# No print statements
‚úÖ grep -r "print(" src/  # Returns nothing

# No TODO comments
‚úÖ grep -r "TODO" src/  # Returns nothing

# All tests pass
‚úÖ pytest tests/ -v  # 100% pass rate

# Requirements file exists
‚úÖ ls requirements.txt  # File exists

# TODO.md is updated
‚úÖ cat TODO.md  # Shows current status
```
